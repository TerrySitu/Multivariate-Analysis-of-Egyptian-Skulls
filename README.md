# Multivariate-Analysis-of-Egyptian-Skulls
We analyzed a data set on the measurements performed on 150 male Egyptian skulls over 5 time periods. Period 1 is 4000 B.C.; period 2 is 3300 B. C.; period 3 is 1850 B. C.; period 4 is 200 B.C.; and period 5 is 150 A.D. The variables consisted of the maximum breadth of skull in mm, basibregmatic height of the skull in mm, basialveolar length of skull in mm, and also nasal height of the skull. More information on these attributes of the skull can be found in the appendix. Researchers suggested that a change in skull size over time is evidence of interbreeding of a resident population with immigrant populations. The purpose of our study was to analyze whether or not there was a significant change in the measurements of the skulls over time. We perform a multivariate analysis using MANOVA on this data set. We check out normality assumptions, perform hypothesis tests on the differences in the means of the measurements between time periods and construct confidence intervals on these difference of means, principle component analysis, and outlier detection analysis.
